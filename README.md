## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# Excellence School Management System

## Database Migration System

This project includes a custom migration system to easily set up the database structure for the Excellence School Management System.

### Migration Files

The database schema is defined in the following migration files:

1. `2025_04_04_000000_create_excellence_database_schema.php` - Creates all tables and basic schema
2. `2025_04_04_000001_seed_initial_data.php` - Seeds the database with initial data (users, courses)
3. `2025_04_04_000002_add_custom_db_functions.php` - Adds custom MySQL functions

### Using the Migration System

You can set up the database using the standard Laravel migration command:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Or use the custom Excellence migration command for additional options:

```bash
# Run migrations
php artisan excellence:migrate

# Run migrations with a fresh database (drops all tables first)
php artisan excellence:migrate --fresh

# Run migrations and seed the database with initial data
php artisan excellence:migrate --seed

# Run migrations with fresh database and seed
php artisan excellence:migrate --fresh --seed
```

### Importing From SQL

If you prefer to import the database directly from SQL, you can use the SQL file:

```bash
mysql -u username -p database_name < excellence_riad.sql
```

### Database Structure

The database includes the following main tables:

- `users` - System users
- `students` - Student records
- `cours` - Regular courses information
- `communication_courses` - Communication courses information 
- `student_courses` - Enrollment relationships between students and courses
- `enrollments` - Historical enrollment records

### Notes

- Migrations will check if tables exist before creating them
- Custom MySQL functions are created to help with calculations
- The system properly handles foreign key constraints
